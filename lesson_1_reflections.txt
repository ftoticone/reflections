I think that difference between two files is an useful way to find bugs and fix them.

File history can allow me to compare easily old versions with last one and so I can find in short time a solution or a bug fix.

The big issue about manual commits is that the developer decide when commiting and so a wrong decision should be fatal.

Multiple file commits are allowed because in projects files are related to other ones and so tracking files in one commit allow developers to build up a single logic unit.
